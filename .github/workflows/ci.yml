      #        # wait a little to start: code coverage usually only takes about 1 1/2 minutes.  If coverage fails, it will
      #        # cancel the other running builds, and we don't want that (because we want to see if jobs fail due to
      #        # build issues, not due to the code-coverage job causing the others to cancel).  We could have used the
      #        # 'need' property (commented out above), and that would wait until all the other jobs have finished before
      #        # starting this one, but that introduces unnecessary (sometimes 2 1/2 minute) delay, whereas delaying the
      #        # start of the code coverage checks a bit should allow everything to finish around the same time without having
      #        # much of an adverse effect on the other jobs above.
