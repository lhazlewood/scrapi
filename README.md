# scrapi: `S`imple `CR`yptography `API`

scrapi (pronounced "scrappy") attempts to be the easiest to use and understand cryptography API for the JVM. It is
intended to be a simpler - but just as feature rich - alternative to the JCA 
([Java Cryptography Architecture](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/security/preface.html)) APIs.

## Background

`scrapi` exists as an answer to one question:

> What would Java security APIs look like if they were designed in 2024?

The JCA (and former JCE - Java Cryptography Extension) APIs were designed and built in a very different era in Java's 
history, before the strong advent of design patterns, generics, and functional interfaces.  As a result, they largely:

* are heavily procedural, and not very Object-Oriented
* often ignore type-safety, using string names and concatenations to initialize objects instead of concrete data types
* avoid generics and their associated conveniences
* use heavyweight checked exceptions that are unnecessarily forceful and cumbersome
* prefer concrete and abstract types instead of interface-driven design, making for difficult-to-maintain implementations
* do not leverage JDK 8+ functional paradigms
* do not often leverage design patterns (like builders, visitors, etc)
* sometimes allow insecure usage patterns unless one is more deeply familiar with cryptographic concepts.

This is not to fault the JVM team at all however, their hands are largely tied for historical and legacy support 
reasons.

## Goals

Scrapi aims to leapfrog these historical limitations in hopes of providing a modern, clean, and elegant security
and cryptography API for the JVM platform.  Scrapi's goals are to be:

* Secure By Default: erroneous or insecure API usage should not be possible or rejected unless explicitly requested 
or overridden by an application developer. An application developer should not need to be a security expert requiring 
nuanced understanding of cryptographic algorithms to be able to use them safely.


* Object-Oriented and less procedural.


* Interface-driven: the large majority of APIs used by application developers should be interfaces, using builders
  and factory design patterns to eliminate tight coupling to implemenations.


* Generic: leverage JDK 7+ generics where feasible.


* Functional: leverage JDK 8+ functional paradigms where appropriate.


* Runtime exception based: to allow application developers to determine if or when they wish to catch exceptions.


* [Fluent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface): use method chaining and builders where appropriate to help
reduce lines of code written by application developers.


* A JEP ([JDK Enhancement Proposal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDK_Enhancement_Proposal)) to become a new official
JDK API if warranted and desired by the Java and JEP community.


## Non-Goals

It is an explicit design goal to _not_ replace the JCA APIs, and instead 'sit on top of' or 'delegate' to them when
feasible.  This ensures Scrapi can be leveraged quickly and conveniently in existing JDK applications, as well as
with existing JCA Provider and HSM (Hardware Security Module) implementations, like 
[BouncyCastle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html).

It is better to 'sit on the shoulders of giants' instead of attempt to remove or replace them.

## Status

This project is experimental and still in initial design stages.  There are no releases yet.

## Design Tenets

### Keys

#### Encoding/Decoding

Unlike `java.security.Key`, `scrapi.Key` instances do not have `getFormat()` or `getEncoded()` methods; formatting
and encoding/decoding key material is an orthogonal concern to key usage and such concepts should not be
tightly coupled to a `Key` concept.

Consequently, key encoders/decoders should exist to handle such concerns.

Additionally, also unlike `java.security.Key`, `scrapi.Key` instances should not extend `java.io.Serializable`, which 
imposes an often-unnecessary implementation burden that many (most?) applications never need as long as the 
aforementioned Key encoders/decoders exist.  PEM, DER, and JWK formats are better serialization mechanisms as they are 
IANA/IETF global standards and not Java-specific.  Custom (even Java-specific) serializations can be implemented with 
custom encoders/decoders if desired.

#### Size/Length

Security keys are often validated by determining a key's size/length in bits, and then asserting if the size is
strong enough for a given cryptographic algorithms.

`java.security.Key` does not provide a polymorphic way to discover a key's size/length in bits, instead forcing
Java developers to engage in messy if-then-else conditionals.  For example:

```java
if (key instanceof SecretKey) {
    SecretKey sk = (SecretKey)key;
    String format = sk.getFormat();
    if ("RAW".equals(format)) {
        byte[] encoded = sk.getEncoded();
        if (encoded != null) {
            size = (encoded.length * 8);
            Arrays.fill(encoded, (byte)0)
        }
    }
} else if (key instanceof RSAKey) {
    RSAKey pubk = (RSAKey)key;
    size = pubk.getModulus().bitLength();
} else if (key instanceof ECKey) {
    ECKey pubk = (ECKey)key;
    size = pubk.getParams().getOrder().bitLength(); 
} else if (key instanceof DSAKey) {
    // ... etc ...
```

This both requires developers to know which specific key properties reflect size as well as how to extract it, and 
unnecessarily forces duplicate logic across any codebase that needs to perform similar behavior.

Additionally, even if a key's encoded bytes are not available (e.g. external in an HSM), various HSMs still are able
to supply length metadata even without supplying the key material/encoded bytes, but `java.security.Key` and its
sub-interfaces do not support such introspection.

Consequently all `scrapi.Key` instances extend `scrapi.BitLength` (providing a `getBitLength()` method) to ensure key 
size can be represented if possible, even if they key material may not be present.

#### Public Key derivation

`java.security.PrivateKey` instances have no capability to obtain or derive their corresponding public key, but this
ability is inherent and implicit in all private key concepts, and should be supported as such.  For example:

```java
aPrivateKey.getPublicKey();
```

Even if a private key's material is not available (e.g. it resides externally from the JVM in an HSM), its associated 
public key is still valuable and often necessary, especially when validating untrusted material, such as within key 
exchange algorithms.

Having this capability may even make the concept of a key `Pair` extraneous and unnecessary.

### Key Pairs

`java.security.KeyPair` is a concrete class and not generics-capable.  `scrapi.lang.Pair` is a generics-capable
interface and new instances can easily be created via `Pair.of(a, b)`.  This ensures public/private key subtypes
are not lost when paired together.

Even so, the concept of a scrapi `Key` pair may not be necessary at all given that all scrapi private keys will be
able to access their associated public key via `privateKey.getPublicKey()`;

### Builders

The JCA `KeyFactory`, `KeyGenerator` and `KeyPairGenerator` concepts are independent and often confusing to 
application developers when one vs the other should be used. Fluent and intuitive `Builder` concepts could likely 
replace both concepts.
